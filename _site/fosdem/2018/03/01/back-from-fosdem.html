<h1>Reflections from FOSDEM 2018</h1>

<p class="view">by Jeremiah</p>

<p>Some quick notes on this year’s <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018">FOSDEM</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>It is as crowded as ever, cramped hallways, long lines for food and
transport, no seats in the classrooms.</li>
  <li>It is as relevant as ever, with a mixed selection of polished,
professional content and less polished, developer-centric content
and presentation.</li>
  <li>Video capture has been standard for a few years, they’ve worked
out some of the kinks and every talk gets coverage. Now they’re
shortening editing times of the videos and making them available
much more quickly. On the second day of the event there were
videos already published and there are at least 54 videos ready
for viewing:
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/news/2018-02-04-first-videos-online/">https://fosdem.org/2018/news/2018-02-04-first-videos-online/</a>
Perhaps more importantly, they now have a stream of the event that
is available on YouTube;
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOPCKYceoPwLI-A7tck3wg This
turns FOSDEM into an entirely different type of event, making the
person to person contact more valuable.</li>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/automated_driving/">OpenADx – xcelerate your Automated Driving development</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Bosch Automated Driving division, together with Microsoft, is
currently building up an ecosystem of companies within the industry
including OEMs, tier 1 suppliers, tool vendors, research organisations
but also partners from other industries like the IT industry. The
intiative called OpenADx is supported by the Eclipse Foundation as a
host for the activities.”</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/automotive_floss/">War Stories from the Automotive FLOSS Front</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Electrobit comes to FOSDEM. This talk by Susanne
Oberhauser-Hirschoff and Stefan Potyra was a bit of a dark horse. It
ended up in the lightning talks instead of the embedded track but I
think it is important because it seems to echo the experience of
many companies as they experience open source and automotive worlds
collide.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/sancus/">Open-Source Trusted Computing for the IoT</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>A researcher from imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven (BE) talks about Trusted computing, particularly for automotive.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/remote_embedded_testing/">Piece of Cake - testing remote embedded devices made easy with MuxPi</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Paweł Wieczorek presented a fresh open hardware approach at
providing remote access (including device flashing, debugging and
power management) for embedded devices.” They’ve created an open
hardware board that allows one to remotely reboot and even flash
hardware - quite useful in distributed teams.</li>
