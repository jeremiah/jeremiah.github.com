Some quick notes on this year's [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018)

 1. It is as crowded as ever, cramped hallways, long lines for food and
    transport, no seats in the classrooms.
 2. It is as relevant as ever, with a mixed selection of polished,
    professional content and less polished, developer-centric content
    and presentation.
 3. Video capture has been standard for a few years, they've worked
    out some of the kinks and every talk gets coverage. Now they're
    shortening editing times of the videos and making them available
    much more quickly. On the second day of the event there were
    videos already published and there are at least 54 videos ready
    for viewing:

    Perhaps more importantly, they now have a stream of the event that
    is available on YouTube;
    https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOPCKYceoPwLI-A7tck3wg This
    turns FOSDEM into an entirely different type of event, making the
    person to person contact more valuable.

### Videos relevant to work in GENIVI
[OpenADx – xcelerate your Automated Driving development](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/automated_driving/)
* "Bosch Automated Driving division, together with Microsoft, is
  currently building up an ecosystem of companies within the industry
  including OEMs, tier 1 suppliers, tool vendors, research organisations
  but also partners from other industries like the IT industry. The
  intiative called OpenADx is supported by the Eclipse Foundation as a
  host for the activities."

[War Stories from the Automotive FLOSS Front](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/automotive_floss/)
* Electrobit comes to FOSDEM. This talk by Susanne
  Oberhauser-Hirschoff and Stefan Potyra was a bit of a dark horse. It
  ended up in the lightning talks instead of the embedded track but I
  think it is important because it seems to echo the experience of
  many companies as they experience open source and automotive worlds
  collide.

[Open-Source Trusted Computing for the IoT](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/sancus/)
* A researcher from imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven (BE) talks about Trusted computing, particularly for automotive.

[Piece of Cake - testing remote embedded devices made easy with MuxPi](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/remote_embedded_testing/)
* "Paweł Wieczorek presented a fresh open hardware approach at
  providing remote access (including device flashing, debugging and
  power management) for embedded devices." They've created an open
  hardware board that allows one to remotely reboot and even flash
  hardware - quite useful in distributed teams. 

### Videos of note
[Component Sourcing for Design and Manufacturing in Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwUL6Afo6QQ)
* Short video with details on how to get trustworthy suppliers of PCB components.

[Igniting the Open Hardware Ecosystem with RISC-V](https://video.fosdem.org/2018/K.1.105/riscv.mp4)
* New ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) maintained by a non-profit Foundation.
