<h2>Reflections from FOSDEM 2018</h2>
Some quick notes on this years [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018)

 1. It is as crowded as ever, cramped hallways, long lines for food and
    transport, no seats in the classrooms.
 2. It is as relevant as ever, with a mixed selection of polished,
    professional content and less polished, developer-centric content
    and presentation.
 3. Video capture has been standard for a few years, they've worked
    out some of the kinks and every talk gets coverage. Now they're
    shortening editing times of the videos and making them available
    much more quickly. On the second day of the event there were
    videos already published and there are at least 54 videos ready
    for viewing:
